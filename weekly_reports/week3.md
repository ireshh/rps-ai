# Week 3 Report

**Total Hours Spent**: Approximately 15 hours

---

## Summary of Work Done

- **Gameplay Update**: I updated the CLI to run infinite loop that can be stopped by 'end' instead of asking each time if the player wants to continue.
- **Score and Percentage**: Iadded a new feature to calculate and display the number of games won by the player vs the ai and the percentage of the games. I also added ties.
- **Implemented Trie Data Structure**: I implemented a basic trie data structure to store and predict player move sequences. It is able to predict moves based on patterns.
- I excluded the if name == main block using the # pragma: no cover comment.
- I ensured that all other parts of the code are fully covered by tests.[100% Coverage]

## Lessons Learned

- By implementing an infinite loop with a break condition, it improved the user experience.
- By adding detailed feedback (scores and percentages), it helps in understanding the how effective the AI is.

## Challenges and Unclear Areas

- I had some challenge ensuring the test handles all edge cases.

## Plan for Next Week

- I will continue to work on the algorithm and add weighted random choice.

## Questions and Feedback for Course Assistant

- I used Tries as per your feedback and they work well. Thanks :D
