# Week 1 Report

**Total Hours Spent**: Approximately 6-7 hours (Finding an ideal project that interests me and is a decent AI project was tough)

---

## Summary of Work Done

During this week, My main focus was on establishing the foundation for my project by completing these following tasks:
- I selected **Rock-Paper-Scissor AI bot** as the project topic.
- I finalized the programming language and project specifications:
  - **Programming Language**: Python
  - **Degree Program**: Bachelor's Programme in Science (BSc)
  - **Documentation Language**: English
- I created a **Project Specification Document** that outlines the project goals, problem definition, key algorithms, data structures, and inputs.
- I set up the project repository on GitHub with version control enabled for all files.
- I enabled **GitHub Issues** for future peer-review assignments and collaboration.
- and I Registered the project on **Labtool** and linked it to the Aineopintojen harjoitustyö: Algoritmit ja tekoäly (periodi 3), Monimuoto-opetus (2024-2025) for tracking and feedback.

## Project Progress

- I believe the project is off to a great start, with the topic decided and project specification completed.
- The Documentation and organizational setup is nearly complete.

## Lessons Learned

- I learned a lot about structuring a project repository to meet this courses requirements, including linking files for easy access and peer review.
- I refreshed my memory on Markdown formatting for documentation, which hopefully will be useful throughout the project.
- I gained a better understanding of defining project specifications, which definitely helped clarify the projects scope and depth.

## Challenges and Unclear Areas

- I did not encounter any significant challenges so far, as this week primarily involved planning and setup and I got tons of help from the moodle page :D

## Plan for Next Week

- I will begin implementing the basic game mechanics and structure for rock-paper-scissors and create the UI and major functionality.
- I will also begin setting up Unit testing systems to allow me to easily test my program.

## Questions and Feedback for Course Assistant

- No major questions at the moment. However, all feedback on the project specification would be appreciated to ensure that my project aligns with course expectations.
