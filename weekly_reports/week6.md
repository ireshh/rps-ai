# Week 6 Report

**Total Hours Spent**: Approximately 14 hours

---

## Summary of Work Done

- I completed major unittests and reworked the single test file into 3 different ones covering each main_game file to ensure good testing practices :D
- I ensured 100% main_game code coverage and tried to achieve good pylint standard.
- I resolved some edge cases in Markov chain prediction and trie sequence handling.
- I reworked the file system to have it seperated better (documentation, main_game, testing, reports etc)

## Plan for Next Week

1. I will finalise the documentation for testing and implementation.
2. I will finish some tests that need to be done before final submission and demos.
