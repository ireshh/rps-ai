# Week 4 Report

**Total Hours Spent**: Approximately 11 hours

---

## Summary of Work Done

- **Gameplay Update**: I updated small quality improvements in CLI. Considering adding a GUI later to make it a full-fledged application.
- **Markov Chain Functionality**: I added Markov chain-based AI prediction, sometimes might not work so need to perfect it next week.
- **Code Refactoring**: I broke one main file into three different ones and placed them under a dedicated folder for better organization.
- The restructuring broke the coverage functionality, so I redid the coverage implementation.
- Not fully implemented again; need to focus more on this in the upcoming week.

## Lessons Learned

- It's crucial to start a project with each part divided into modules from the beginning to ensure easier scalability.
- Refactoring can make understanding the project structure harder, especially when reorganizing files into different folders.
- Understanding unittest coverage across multiple files is hard.

## Challenges and Unclear Areas

- I had difficulty understanding how to properly handle unittest coverage with multiple files.

## Plan for Next Week

- I will continue improving the project structure and make it more polished.
- I will make sure full test coverage to ensure all functionalities work.
