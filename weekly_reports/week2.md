# Week 2 Report

**Total Hours Spent**: Approximately 14 hours

---

## Summary of Work Done

During this week, My main focus was on creating the base foundation for my project by completing these following tasks:

- **Core Game Module**: I was able to implement base game logic to allow development for AI rps player(user input, computer choice, winner and game loop).
- **Unit Tests**: I wrote tests for all functions using unittest.mock.
- **Test Coverage**: I was able to achieve 98% coverage for base_game.py and test_base_game.py using coverage.
- **Code Quality**: I was able to also set up pylint.
- **Basic Research**: Read up on Markov Chains for the future.

## Project Progress

- The Core game is nearly done and tests completed.
- Test coverage is set up and I tried to improve code quality.
- I started reading and learning more about Markov Chains and the PDF.

## Lessons Learned

- It was hard to set up coverage and dealing with unittest.mock took some time.
- I learnt more about code coverage and pylint helped me make better code decisions.

## Challenges and Unclear Areas

- **Test Coverage**: Initially missed covering the break statement. I was able to fix it with additional tests.
- **Markov Chains**: I am pretty unsure rn how to efficiently implement the transition matrix and integrate it into the game but we will figure it out soon :D

## Plan for Next Week

- Start actually implementing the AI algorithms and finish up base game.

## Questions and Feedback for Course Assistant

- Thanks for the feedback. I realise there is no need for a basic randomizer AI, just the rps-AI that would be created at the end of this project.
